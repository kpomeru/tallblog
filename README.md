## An Advanced TALL Stack Blog

Tallblog is a blog project built on Laravel and simple stacks/technologies. It implements the TALL stack, throughout the application. I would be covering the basics of how I implemented this project; this is on the assumption that you (a potential) fullstack developer is intermediate or a beginner with preliminary knowledge on Laravel, AlpineJS, Livewire and TailwindCSS.

We will be adding Docker to this repo
